    "Building a `PhotonicDevice` is where you, as a designer, will be spending the majority of your time. It is a very tedius and cumbersome task, as you have to get all the material parameters right as well as the geometry. Luckily, with the `Imodulator` you only have to do this once. While using this software, we have found it easier to to wrap the creation of the `PhotonicDevice` in a python class, but feel free to do as you see fit. \n",
