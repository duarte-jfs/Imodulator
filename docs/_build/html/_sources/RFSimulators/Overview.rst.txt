The RF properties of an electro-optical modulator are of utmost importance as it will define how our device behaves with high-speed electronics. 

- :doc:`RFSimulatorFEMWELL`: A FEM mode solver built around FEMWELL_ and skfem_. With this tool we can calculate the RF mode supported by our structure, and thus propagation constant, but we're also able to calculate the characteristic impedance, small signal S parameters and equivalent RLGC transmission line model parameters [:cite:`marks_general_1992`, :cite:`rizzi_microwave_1988`].
